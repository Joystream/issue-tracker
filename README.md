# Issue tracker
A repo to collect all issues related to the Joystream testnets. It is meant to be an internal tool, but we are keeping it open for transparancy.

## Workflow
Note that this repo is not dedicated exclusively to software related issues, but is also for noting and tracking issues related to communication, marketing, community development, etc. Keep in mind that urgency and importance should be evaluated with the relavant`OKR` in mind. 

1. A problem or issue is reported in one of our social media channels, on the relevant github repo, you discover it yourself, etc.
2. Check if this `issue` has been reported already.
   
   A. **If not:** Create an `issue` in this repo, with a brief description and/or link to the problem. Set the appropriate `tags`.

    i)  If the issue is software related:
      * Tag the issue with the testnet `codename`, the `repo` it concerns, and a classification of the issue (`enhancement`, `bug`, etc.)
      * If you consider it urgent and important, `escalate` it by making an `issue` in the applicable repo, where you refer to the `helpdesk issue`.
      * Add the `issue` in the applicable `issue-tracker` project, and place it on the approppriate kanban board position.
    
    ii) If the issue is related to communication, marketing, etc: 
      * Tag the `issue` with the testnet `codename`, the `team` it concerns, and a classification of the issue (`enhancement`, `bug`, etc.)
      * If you consider it urgent and important, `escalate` it by making a `task` in Asana, where you refer to the `helpdesk issue` and assign it to the person it concerns.
      * Add the `issue` in the applicable `issue-tracker` project, and place it on the approppriate kanban board position.

    B. **If yes:** Make a comment on the the exisiting `issue`, adding relevant updates, comments, links and `tags`. Reposition on the kanban board if appropriate.

3. Once a week, the relevant `team` members will go through the `project` and assess the `issues` one by one.
4. All new `issues` will be moved to the appropriate position, based on the teams evaluation of its urgency and importance.
