# Ticket tracker
A repo to collect all `tickets` related to the Joystream testnets. It is meant to be an internal tool, but we are keeping it open for transparancy.

## Workflow
Note that this repo is not dedicated exclusively to software related `tickets`, but is also for noting and tracking issues `tickets` to communication, marketing, community development, etc. Keep in mind that urgency and importance should be evaluated with the relevant OKR in mind.

1. A problem, bug, feature request, etc. is brought to your attention. This can be from one of our social media channels, a github repo, you discover it yourself, or something else.
2. Check if there is already a `ticket` for this particular thing.
   
   A. **If not:** Create an [issue]((https://github.com/Joystream/ticket-tracker/projects)) in this repo, with a brief description and/or link to the problem.

    i)  If the `ticket` is software related:
      * Tag the `issue` with the testnet `codename`, the `repo` it concerns, and a classification of the issue (`enhancement`, `bug`, etc.)
      * If you consider the `ticket` urgent and important, `escalate` it by making an `issue` in the applicable repo, where you refer to the `ticket-tracker`.
      * Add the `issue` to the `ticket-tracker` [project](https://github.com/Joystream/ticket-tracker/projects), and place it on the approppriate kanban board position.
    
    ii) If the `ticket` is related to communication, marketing, etc: 
      * Tag the `issue` with the testnet `codename`, the `team` it concerns, and a classification of the issue (`enhancement`, `bug`, etc.)
      * If you consider the `ticket` urgent and important, `escalate` it by making a `task` in Asana, where you refer to the `ticket-tracker` and assign it to the person it concerns.
      * Add the `issue` to the `ticket-tracker` [project](https://github.com/Joystream/ticket-tracker/projects), and place it on the approppriate kanban board position.

    B. **If yes:** Make a comment on the the exisiting `issue`, adding relevant updates, comments, links and `tags`. Reposition on the kanban board if appropriate.

3. Once a week, the relevant `team` members will go through the `project` and assess the `issues` one by one.
4. All new `issues` will be moved to the appropriate position, based on the teams evaluation of its urgency and importance.
