# helpdesk
A repo to collect all issues related to the Joystream testnets

## Workflow

Note that this repo is not dedicated exclusively to software related issues, but is also for noting and tracking issues related to communication, marketing, community development, etc.

1. A problem or issue is reported in one of our social media channels, on the relevant github repo, you discover it yourself, etc.
2. Create an `issue` in this repo, with a brief description or link to the problem. If applicable, assign or notify the relevant person with a `cc`
3. If you are assigned the issue, consider the urgency and importance as compared to your other current tasks
   1. If the issue is software related:
      * If you considered sufficiently important, make in `issue` in the applicable repo, where you refer to the `helpdesk issue`.
      *  Close the `issue` here in `helpdesk` as it is has been escalated (if not resolved).
      *  If the issue is not a top priority, just keep it open in `helpdesk` without opening a new `issue` in the applicable repo.
   2.   If the issue is related to communication, marketing, etc:
          * If you consider is sufficiently large and important, add it as a `task` in Asana, where you refer to the `helpdesk issue`.
          *  Close the `issue` here in `helpdesk` as it is has been escalated (if not resolved).
          * If the issue is smaller, but important, try to resolve it right away, and close it in `helpdesk`
          * If the issue is not a top priority, just keep it open in `helpdesk` without opening a new `task` in Asana.
4. If there is already an open `helpdesk issue`, open `task` in Asana, or an open `issue` in the applicable repo for what you are reporting, make a comment to let the relevant person know that this has been reported again.
