# Issue tracker
A repo to collect all issues related to the Joystream testnets. It is meant to be an internal tool, but we are keeping it open for transparancy.

## Workflow

Note that this repo is not dedicated exclusively to software related issues, but is also for noting and tracking issues related to communication, marketing, community development, etc.

1. A problem or issue is reported in one of our social media channels, on the relevant github repo, you discover it yourself, etc.
2. Create an `issue` in this repo, with a brief description or link to the problem. Set the appropriate `tags`.
   1. If the issue is software related:
      * Tag the issue with the testnet `codename`, the `repo` it concerns, and a classification of the issue (`enhancement`, `bug`, etc.)
      * If you consider it urgent and important, make in `issue` in the applicable repo, where you refer to the `helpdesk issue`.
      * Add the `issue` in the applicable ` project.
   2.   If the issue is related to communication, marketing, etc: 
      * Tag the `issue` with the testnet `codename`, the `department` it concerns, and a classification of the issue (`enhancement`, `bug`, etc.)
      * If you consider it urgent and important, add it as a `task` in Asana, where you refer to the `helpdesk issue` and assign it to the person it concerns.
      * 
1. If there is already an open `helpdesk issue`, open `task` in Asana, or an open `issue` in the applicable repo for what you are reporting, make a comment to let the relevant person know that this has been reported again.
